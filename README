Welcome. This is an experimental attempt at a simpler approach to large project
build frameworks for C applications and librares. It may also become the actual
library of utility data structures and everyday reusable app functionality. The
current list of functionality is:

 * cmd_line_yn - The basic proof of concept for the library, a yN with prompt.

Overclocked Development Environment, tldr:

  mkdir env
  cd env
  git clone https://github.com/overclocked/ocic.git
  cd ocic
  make

Now you should have the ocic library, ready to link.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
 [ ] Build a proper introduction to the conventions of the OC build env.
 [ ] Add more functionality to ocic as needed.

FAQ:

Q: What is this?

A: ocic is a general purpose library of fundamental code that rely on nothing
   but standard C, and which might be useful for application development.

Q: Where are you going with this?

A: The desire is to simply add functionality as needed, and refine performance
   also as needed. The main thing is: it should work.

Q: Who is involved?

A: At this time, Overclocked is a one-person team. Bluejack. 

Q: Could I get involved?

A: If you are inspired, reach out to bluejack.

Q: What does 'ocic' mean?

A: OC = OverClocked. IC = "I see". It kind of sounds good.
   Hopefully, you *will* see!
